These scripts will start Xvfb (http://www.xfree86.org/4.0.1/Xvfb.1.html) as a daemon.

They are written for init/LSB type systems like RHEL or Debian.
They were originally written to support image generation for Oracle 9i Application Server.
As uploaded they will start an X server on localhost:5


INSTALL:

You will need Xvfb and twm installed on your host to use these scripts.
On RHEL/Centos/OEL you can install the packages with the following command

   yum install xorg-x11-server-Xvfb xorg-x11-twm

On Debian:
   
   apt-get install xvfb twm

After you insure those packages are installed copy xvfbdm and xvfbdm-twm to /etc/init.d
On RHEL/Centos/OEL 5 run the following commands

   chkconfig xvfbdm on
   chkconfig xvfbdm-twm on 

This will set them up to auto start and stop, you can start them manualy with

   service xvfbdm start
   service xvfbdm-twm start


They also have restart and stop and status functionality with the service command.

If you ssh into the host with X11 forwarding support or if you set your DISPLAY variable you can view the current state of the screen by running the following command.

xwud -in /usr/tmp/Xvfb_screen0
